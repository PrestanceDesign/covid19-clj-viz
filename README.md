# COVID19 Visualizations in Clojure with Vega

Inspired from David Liepmann repo (https://github.com/appliedsciencestudio/covid19-clj-viz). COVID-19 cases in Latin America are recently raising, we wanted to visualize how is COVID-19 spreading in South America.

## Usage

1. Clone the [Johns Hopkins dataset repo](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) to *resources/* within this repo
2. Open `appliedsciencestudio.covid19-clj-viz.viz-south-america`, connect a Clojure CLI REPL, and evaluate forms. Oz (the Vega wrapper) will open a browser window to display the visualizations.
